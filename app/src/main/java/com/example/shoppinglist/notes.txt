 - the challenge here will be in storing the data, not writing the functionality itself as the UI and
the functions of the components are generally simple
 - how do I connect the app to Firebase to store lists there?

 - still need to work out how to connect to a remote repository and push changes

 - when adding a list do I put another EditText in NewListDialog or just leave description blank
 and edit it in ListActivity? (there will be an edit function there anyway)

 - when is Parcelable used? do I really need it?

 - can I really finish this app before learning about databases?

 - do I need a callback interface in NewListDialog?
    no, but let's use one anyway

 - E/SpannableStringBuilder: SPAN_EXCLUSIVE_EXCLUSIVE spans cannot have a zero length   is displayed
 in the logcat when I click on the EditText in the NewListDialog to access the keyboard - why?

MainActivity.java:

ListDisplayerRecyclerViewAdapter.java:

Utils.java:
    this class is the access point to the list of lists stored on device memory, so I can access
    them by calling one method

List.java:
    a model class
    each List item represents a List object, which has an arraylist on the items themselves and a
    description

ListActivity.java:
